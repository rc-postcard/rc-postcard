## Build and Run
Create an OAuth application at [https://www.recurse.com/settings/apps](https://www.recurse.com/settings/apps) with proper redirect URI (http://localhost:8080/auth for local run).
**Make sure to set your app's ID, Secret, and Redirect URI in your environmental variables** (see [.env.example](.env.example)). You can optionally set your own redis host and password.

Create an account on [lob.com](https://lob.com) and set your API keys in your environment variables (see [.env.example](.env.example)).

```shell
# Load your environmental variables after setting them
# Note: we recommend copying the blank .env.example into a .env file and setting your environmental variables there.
ðŸŽ¨ source .env

# Run rc-postcard app
ðŸŽ¨ make run
```
ðŸŽ‰ rc-postcard should now be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
