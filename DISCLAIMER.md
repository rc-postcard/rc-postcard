# DISCLAIMER (UPDATED 4/8/2022)

rc-postcard is designed so that recursers can send postcards to eachother, ideally without having to reveal your address to eachother directly.

However there are some leaks
- Addresses are stored in a lob.com account. Lob.com is the service used to send postcards progammatically.
- Code could be insecure (check out on https://github.com/rc-postcard/rc-postcard, our app is hosted on fly.io)
- And most importantly:
# The owner of the lob.com account (at this time Joseph Tobin) has access to every address uploaded and postcard sent. He has no plans and no desire to go through your postcards or addresses. The only time when he expects to go through postcards or addresses is for debugging purposes and he will avoid when he can. Nonetheless, please be mindful of this, feel free to propose a better solution, and don't forget to follow the RC guidelines when interacting with RC-Postcard.
